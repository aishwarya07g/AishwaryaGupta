    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <h2>Hello there!</h2>
    <br />

    <p>
      I am Aishwarya, a computer science major based in Bangalore, India with a
      thriving passion to change the perspective of how technology and design
      work hand-in-hand, in a cognitive way. I am also an artist, a travel
      enthusiast, a space fanatic, a dog lover and a crazy indie music fangirl.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a child, I always wondered about space. Yes, I was indeed trapped in
      its enchanting beauty. The glowing stars and its magnificent planets. Ever
      since my childhood, I've been privileged to grow up around people who
      inspire me to achieve my dreams. My sister, who has always been fascinated
      with the field of science and art, enthralled me to get creative and
      ambitious with technology.

      Today, I am a final year student who would love to explore the world full
      of opportunities and wishes to fulfill her childhood dreams. As Randy
      Pausch once said, 'Follow your passions, believe in karma, and you won't
      have to chase your dreams, they will come to you.'
